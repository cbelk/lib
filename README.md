# lib

These are a couple of golang libraries I made for some projects I am workng on.

Install:
  $ go get github.com/cbelk/lib/http          ***This will install the loggers library as well since it is used in httpHelpers***
  $ go get github.com/cbelk/lib/loggers       ***This will download the httpHelpers source, but will not install it***
